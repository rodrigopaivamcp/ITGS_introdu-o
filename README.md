+ The file above explains what I learned in the ITGS class
+ ITGS stands for (Information Technology in a Global Society)
+ It was an amazing opportunity to learn about the positive impacts of tech in today's global connectivity
+ It also warned about the potential problems that may arise if we don't bear in mind the ethics needed to deal with technology
